Overview
This document provides an overview of a distributed messaging platform using Kafka. It highlights the concept, architecture, and benefits of using Kafka for real-time data streaming and processing.

Concept
Producers: Entities that produce data and send it to Kafka topics.
Topics: Categories or feed names where records are stored and published.
Partitions: Sub-divisions of topics that allow data distribution across multiple Kafka brokers.
Consumers: Entities that consume data from Kafka topics.
Key Features
High Throughput: Kafka can handle high-velocity data streams.
Scalability: Easily scalable horizontally by adding more brokers.
Fault Tolerance: Provides fault tolerance through data replication across brokers.
Durability: Data is persisted and replicated to prevent data loss.
Use Case
Kafka is used to build real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. Example: Tracking the live location of drivers for a food delivery service like Zomato or Uber.

Architecture
Producers send data to Kafka topics.
Kafka Brokers store data in topics divided into partitions.
Consumers read data from Kafka topics and process it.
Data Flow
Producers generate data and publish it to specific Kafka topics.
Data is partitioned and stored in Kafka brokers.
Consumers subscribe to topics and read data for processing and analysis.
Advantages Over Traditional Databases
Real-time Data Processing: Unlike databases, Kafka allows real-time data streaming and processing.
Higher Throughput: Kafka handles a higher volume of data with low latency.
Scalability: Easily scales with the addition of more nodes.
Kafka Components
Producer API: To publish data to Kafka topics.
Consumer API: To consume data from Kafka topics.
Streams API: To process data in real-time.
Connector API: To integrate Kafka with external systems.
